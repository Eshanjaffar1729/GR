#Reflection

Languages are something we all use in our day-to-day life. Most of us learned to speak our mother tongue without much formal education, But often it is rare for a person to think deeply about their native tongue and the role it plays in their daily life. I have been negligent about the role of my mother tongue for a very long time, but reading the last lesson sparked a flame in me. I was curious to know whether languages were something we have been taking for granted without thinking about the sophisticated role it has been playing in our life. Since my teammates shared the same curiosity, we were able to choose linguistic chauvinism as our topic. Working with a team of like-minded colleagues has been a boisterous experience. The questions were picked after much discussion. Through the survey, we were able to come across a wide variety of people and were able to note their unique take on their mother tongue. Through this survey, I realised that our native tongues are something that we should take pride in and must not feel ashamed or embarrassed to speak it.
